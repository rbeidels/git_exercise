A long time, in a stadium floating in the end of galaxy...
It is one million years after Jesus dies.
People won't go to heaven, becuase everyone is immortal.
However, from some point people forgot how to sing.
Thus, there is a group people who wonder in the galaxy and search for the lost melodies.
We call them wanderers.
Kayne is, or at least was, one of them.
1000 years ago, or may 10000 years ago. Anyway, time has no meaning for people at this age anymore. 
Kayne went to the star of Tylor.
By methology, the greatest singer in the universe, Tylor Swift, lives in the star.
The center of the star was digged out and becomes a stadium.
Tylor would sing in the center of the star tonight.
Kayne ain't got no ticket, but he is alright.
He just killed all the guards, and went straight in.
When he finally broke into the stadium, the show has begun.
He went to Tylor Swift.
And face to face, he shot to Tylor Swift.
"You ain't no singer. You can't sing."
